        "notes": "There are a variety of different methods currently employed to help with communication between people with ASD and general communicative disabilities, all considered under the AAC, or Augmented and Alternative methods of Communication. The methods being compared and discussed in this paper are speech generating devices (SGD), mobile applications, picture exchange communication systems (PECS), AI/ML, and augmented reality (AR) based applications. The paper highlights the conveniences and inconveniences of each method detailed in various studies of each method, and explores the paradigm shift from traditional PECS methods to more AI/ML and AR based methods.",

        "notes": "Immersive VR applications are growing increasingly popular within several fields of healthcare. For communication in particular, immersive VR environments may be a valid method for communication partners and the public to interact with those who have communication disabilities. The gamification of education can help to develop medical students' knowledge in medical interactions, and also interpersonal communication skills in general. However, it must be noted that VR environments, by being more immersive, can easily distort our perception of reality. It is important to be aware of how VR is representing certain demographics, cultures, and environments in general in order to not influence the users' intrinsic biases. There are also safety concerns when using VR for a prolonged period of time, such as motion sickness or \"cyber sickness\"",
