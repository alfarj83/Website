## **Development Guidelines**

### 1. **Design & Aesthetics**
   - Keep the design **clean, minimal, and accessible**, focusing on ease of navigation.
   - Use **contrasting colors** for clarity, with an emphasis on readability for the research materials.
   - Ensure the website is **responsive** and accessible across different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
   - Adhere to **accessibility standards** (e.g., WCAG), including alt text for images, proper heading structure, and keyboard navigability.

### 2. **Technical Requirements**
   - Use **modern web technologies** (HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap.JavaScript/React for the front end).
   - For the backend, consider **Django/Flask/MongoDB**  or **Node.js**  for handling the database and user interactions.
   - Utilize a **NoSQL or SQL database** to store research papers, notes, and code experiments.

### 3. **Content Management**
   - Use Markdown for posts and articles to allow easy editing and formatting.
   - Standardize formatting for research papers, literature reviews, and experiment explanations.
   - Implement user roles (Admin, Editor, Contributor) to manage content submissions and edits effectively.

### 4. **Security & Privacy**
   - Ensure proper **authentication** and access controls, particularly for uploading and editing sensitive content.
   - Adhere to data privacy standards when handling user information.
   - Enable **HTTPS** for secure browsing.
   - Regularly back up the databases to prevent data loss.

### 5. **Open Source Contribution Guidelines**
   - Use **GitHub** for version control, with a clear branching strategy (main, dev, feature branches).
   - Create a **README.md** and **CONTRIBUTING.md** file to guide contributors.

## **Task List**
